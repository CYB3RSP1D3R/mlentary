        Can I just say Chris for one moment that I have a new theory about the
        brontosaurus. ...  This theory goes as follows and begins now. All
        brontosauruses are thin at one end, much, much thicker in the middle
        and then thin again at the far end. That is my theory, it is mine, and
        belongs to me and I own it, and what it is too.
