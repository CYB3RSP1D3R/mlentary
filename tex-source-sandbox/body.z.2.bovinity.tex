% solving other classification tasks by the same method
\sampassage{worked example: bovinity of reddit posts}
  Digits are nice.  Let's solve a couple other tasks by the same method.  This
  illustrates which aspects are design decisions and which aren't.  We'll start
  with a text-classification task.

  %\textbf{reddit posts about cows vs dogs}
  We gather the text of $\sim 2000$ reddit posts, half from \texttt{r/cow} and
  half from \texttt{r/dog}.  \emph{Can we predict from text alone which of the
  two subreddits a post came from?}

  Intuitively, words like
  \texttt{cow},
  \texttt{hoof},
  \texttt{moo},
    or
  \texttt{dog},
  \texttt{paw},
  \texttt{bark}
  are tell-tale signs.  So for our featurization, let's have a feature for
  each $3$-letter and each $4$-letter word.  The feature for the word
  \texttt{hoof} simply maps a text input $x$ in $\xX$ to a real number that's
  $1$ if the word appears in the post and $0$ otherwise.  Likewise with the
  other features.
