  %\textbf{seeing around walls}
  Let's collect 200 photos of a certain MIT hallway corner.  In half, there's
  some large obstacle (e.g.\ a person) right around the corner.  In the other
  half, there's no obstacle.  \emph{Can we distinguish these cases from pixels
  alone?}

  Intuitively, if this prediction is possible it'd be based on subtle shading
  arising from multiply reflected light.  So we'll probably want to
  invent features to do with brightness.
