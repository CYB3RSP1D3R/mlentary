%      %\sampassage{workflow: framing}
%        We first \emph{frame}: what data will help us solve what problem?  To
%        do this, we \emph{factor} our complex prediction problem into simple
%        classification or regression problems; randomly \emph{split} the
%        resulting example pairs into training, dev(elopment), and testing sets;
%        and \emph{visualize} the training data to weigh our intuitions.
%
%      %\sampassage{workflow: modeling}
%        Next, we \emph{model}: we present the data to the computer so that
%        true patterns are more easily found.
%        %
%        Here we inject our \emph{domain knowledge} --- our human experience and
%        intuition about which factors are likely to help with prediction.
%        %
%        Modeling includes \emph{featurizing} our inputs and choosing
%        appropriate \emph{priors} and \emph{symmetries}.
%
%      %\sampassage{workflow: training}
%        During \emph{training}, the computer searches among candidate patterns
%        for one that explains the examples relatively well.
%        We used brute force above; we'll soon learn faster algorithms
%        such as \emph{gradient descent} on the training set for parameter
%        selection and \emph{random grid search} on the dev set for
%        hyperparameter selection.
%
%      %\sampassage{workflow: harvesting}
%        Finally, we may \emph{harvest}: we derive insights from the pattern
%        itself\bovinenote{%
%            which factors ended up being most important?
%        }
%        and we predict outputs for to fresh inputs.
%        %
%        Qualifying both applications is the pattern's quality.  To assess this,
%        we measure its accuracy on our held-out testing data.
